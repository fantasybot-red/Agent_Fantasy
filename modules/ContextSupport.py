        - Always include at least one embed in the response.

        - Do not repeat embed content in the message text.
        - Split long content across up to 10 embeds if needed.
        - Embed titles allow plain text only (no mentions or markdown).
        - Use normal message text to mention users if notification is needed.
        - To display an image, use the 'image' or 'thumbnail' (URLs in content wonâ€™t show images).
        - You only have one chance to set embeds.
